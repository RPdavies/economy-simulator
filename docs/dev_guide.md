# Developer Guide

## Repo

The code is divided into 3 parts: the simulator itself, the command-line
interface for the simulator, and the web app. These are in the simulator/,
cli/, and web_app/ subdirectories, respectively.

Docs are in the docs/ subdirectory.

```
- cli/
  - main.py       main executable
  - plot.py       plots the results of the simulation
- simulator/
  - simulator.py  the actual simulator
  - test.py       tests for the simulator

```
